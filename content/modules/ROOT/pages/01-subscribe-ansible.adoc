== Install RHEL System Roles

Red Hat Enterprise Linux System Roles are a collection of supported
Ansible roles that ensure consistent workflows and streamline the
execution of manual tasks.

This lab consists of two hosts, `+rhel+` and `+client1+`. The `+rhel+` host is the Ansible controller and the `+client1+` host is the Ansible managed node. We'll be using the `+rhel+` host to run the Ansible playbook but we'll be modifying the configurations of both hosts.

First we’ll install the `+rhel-system-roles+` package. Copy and paste
the command below into *> rhel*.

You can also run the following command in the terminal by clicking on this icon just above the code block below:

Try it now.

[source,bash,run]

dnf -y install rhel-system-roles

Here’s what the result should look similar to.
